# dotfiles

## WIP

Getting all of this into shape. Opted to flatten to structure over a separate dirctory for each section (e.g. git). Dotfiles remain in .dotfiles folder and are symlink'd to from $HOME

## Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

## Brew Bundle file

[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)

Use `brew bundle` to install dependencies listed in bundle file, *Brewfile*

## Future Thoughts

Add Homebrew stuff to bootstrap? Still not sure if I want a single run.

Add cask installs to Brewfile (e.g. Atom, vscode)
